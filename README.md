# Unreal Dumper

Unreal Dumper is a simple app that automates the process of finding/dumping any unreal engine games offsets. It also generates a game SDK in seconds. This is a helpful tool for any game cheat developers as it allows them to update their products as soon as the game updates.

## Compatibility

This works for all Unreal Engine 4+ games. It has not been tested for older versions but it might work.

This is not an executable, this is a dll that you inject into your game of choice to dump the offsets and game sdk.

## Features

- Dump all game offsets
- Generate game SDK
- Fast Execution
- Open Source

## How to use

### Build

To use the release, download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/paysonism/UnrealDumper/releases/latest) tab.
Now, run the exe as administrator and then once the driver loads open your game. Now, when it injects you should see a cmd window open with the auto dumped offsets aswell as the SDK file path.

## Source

To use the source, simply build the source as release. This will place a dll in the build folder. Now just inject this dll using any dll injector and your good to go!
